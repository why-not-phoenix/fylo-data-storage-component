## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Took a short course on CSS and building responsive layouts so used this to practice.
Also I think compared to my previous solutions, I was more organized in this and I really enjoyed seeing how far I've gone.

### Continued development

Struggled with the tooltip. Still do not understand how arrows work.
Wanted to include js to make the progress bar more functional but it started looking too complicated so I decided to learn up a bit before coming back to it.
